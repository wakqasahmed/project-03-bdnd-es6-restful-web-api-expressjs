# Project #3. RESTful Web API with Express.js (a Node.js Framework)

This is Project 3, RESTful Web API with Express.js (a Node.js Framework), in this project I have created an API for the private blockchain and exposed functionality that can be consumed by several types of web clients ranging from desktop, mobile, and IoT devices. The API project required two endpoints:

GET block
POST block

## Setup project for Review.

To setup the project for review do the following:
1. Download/Clone the project.
2. Run command __npm install__ to install the project dependencies.
3. Run command __node simpleChain.js__ in the root directory.

## Testing the project

In order to test the functionality you could use the following tools:

1. Postman
* download collection
* send GET and POST requests (make sure to run the command `node simpleChain.js` and keep the terminal open and command running)

2. cURL

## What did I learn with this Project

* I was able to create a RESTful API using variety of Node.js Frameworks for a Blockchain application.
